# Classes

Python classes should be defined as **Pydantic** models to be supported. 

## Classes with only primitive types

Lets start with a simple example,

```python title="main.py" linenums="1"
--8<-- "tutorial/simple-classes/main.py"
```

then execute,

```sh
$ uvicorn main:app --reload
```

open <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>

    Please don't take the Star Wars referencet so seriusly. Height and age of

## Dissecting the Code

Again, lets take a closer look into the code.

### Step 1: Importing `BaseModel`

```python title="main.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="5"
--8<-- "tutorial/simple-classes/main.py"
```

Here we import **Pydantic's** base class for all models, 
<a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/" target="_blank">`pydantic.BaseModel`</a>.
As mentioned already, this is the base class for all classes handled by **FastGraphQL**.

### Step 2: Annotating your class

```python title="main.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="11"
--8<-- "tutorial/simple-classes/main.py"
```

`#!python fastgraphql.FastGraphQL.type()` is used to annotate classes those will be 
part of the GraphQL schema.

!!! Note "Best Practices"
    Eventhough `#!python fastgraphql.FastGraphQL.type()` can be ommited, if the class is being 
    used in a query or in a mutation and if there is no naming conflict, annotating your 
    classes should be considered a best-practice 

!!! Note "Customizations"
    `#!python fastgraphql.FastGraphQL.type()` and internal classes attributes can be 
    customized. This topic will be covered in [Classes Customizations](license.md)

### Step 3: Defining your class

```python title="main.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="12-16"
--8<-- "tutorial/simple-classes/main.py"
```

Models can be defined exactly as **Pydantic** documents its 
models definitions. Take a pick under 
<a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#basic-model-usage" target="_blank">Basic model usage</a>

### Step 4: Use your class

```python title="main.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="19 20"
--8<-- "tutorial/simple-classes/main.py"
```

As in the previous chapter, we annotate a function with `#!python @fast_graphql.query()`,
define the function signature and return type and done!
