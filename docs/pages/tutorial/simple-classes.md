Python classes should be defined as **Pydantic** models to be supported. 

## Classes with only primitive types

Lets start with a simple example,

```python title="main.py" linenums="1"
--8<-- "tutorial/simple-classes/main.py"
```

then execute,

```sh
$ uvicorn main:app --reload
```

open <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>
