# Queries and Mutations

Define queries and mutations in the context of GraphQL
is define the way any consumer will interact with the
server serving the GraphQL API.

Exposing them using *FastGraphQL* is very straigh forward
as we saw in the example on the previous section.

Lets go a little deeper on how to define them.

## Queries and muntation in Python code

**FastGraphQL** handles query and mutations as python
functions which have type annotations for all its
parameters and return type.

!!! note "Can Query act as mutation?"

    "*Because there is no restriction on what can be done inside resolvers,
    technically thereâ€™s nothing stopping somebody from making Queries
    act as mutations, taking inputs and executing state-changing logic.*

    *In practice such queries break the contract with client libraries
    such as Apollo-Client that do client-side caching and state management,
    resulting in non-responsive controls or inaccurate information being
    displayed in the UI as the library displays cached data before redrawing
    it to display an actual response from the GraphQL.*"

### Queries

As you have already noticed on the previous chapters, defining queries is as simple
as annotating a python function with `#!python FastGraphQL.query()`. Let's see
again the first tutorial example:

```python title="main.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="9"
--8<-- "tutorial/index/main.py"
```

### Mutation

Similar to queries, mutations are defined by annotating a method with
`#!python FastGraphQL.mutation()`. Let's see an example:

```python title="main.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="9"
--8<-- "tutorial/query-mutation/main.py"
```
